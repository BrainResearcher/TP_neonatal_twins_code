# TP_neonatal_twins_code

The above folders contain scripts used for data analyses described in the manuscript entitled â€œThe innate neural representation network mechanisms of semantic knowledge: converging evidence from neonatal and adult twin studies". We have also uploaded the brain images of adult and neonatal TP parcellations, as well as the neural network masks used in the ROI analyses.
